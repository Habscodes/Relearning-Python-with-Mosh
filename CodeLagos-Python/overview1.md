Python does not look like a lot of other languages
No Braces
or Semicolons

Line Ending and Indention are meaningful

in Python Everything is an Object

Before We delve into the World of Language Features
it is useful to see how all the pieces fit together

This Chapter provides that Bird's-Eye View of the Language as a whole
we will use examples to describe different element of Python Syntax
without getting into much details about how each features works
The idea is getting familiar with the syntax of the language so
that you may better learn it features later
don't worry about the details for now

we will get into a lot of the details in the later chapter

Think of this chapter has the cover picture for a puzzle
so you have the vision of what the whole puzzle looks like as you gather all the pieces
